 *  This function may also deny mouse input to other windows--both those in

 *  function sparingly, and in small bursts. For example, you might want to
 *  track the mouse while the user is dragging something, until the user
 *  releases a mouse button. It is not recommended that you capture the mouse
 *  for long periods of time, such as the entire time your app is running.
 *
 *  While captured, mouse events still report coordinates relative to the
 *  current (foreground) window, but those coordinates may be outside the
 *  bounds of the window (including negative values). Capturing is only
 *  allowed for the foreground window. If the window loses focus while
 *  capturing, the capture will be disabled automatically.
 *
 *  While capturing is enabled, the current window will have the
 *  SDL_WINDOW_MOUSE_CAPTURE flag set.
